# Deep-Lerning-algorithms-Internship


Description:

This repository contains the source code for a deep learning model that predicts whether a given cell image contains any type of lymphoma. The model utilizes a U-Net architecture, a popular convolutional neural network (CNN) design for image segmentation, and is trained on a dataset of cell images labeled with lymphoma status. The project aims to provide a tool for assisting medical professionals in the early detection and diagnosis of lymphoma.

Features:

    U-Net architecture: A powerful CNN model designed for image segmentation, specifically adapted for cell image analysis.
    Multi-class classification: The model can predict multiple types of lymphoma, providing a comprehensive diagnosis.
    Data augmentation: Techniques are employed to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, improving model robustness.
    Performance evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the model's performance.

Technologies Used:

    TensorFlow: A popular open-source machine learning framework used for model development and training.
    Keras: A high-level API for building and training deep learning models, simplifying the development process.
    PyTorch: Another popular open-source machine learning library, used for model implementation and optimization.
    Pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for data preprocessing and handling.
    NumPy: A fundamental library for numerical computing in Python, used for array operations and mathematical calculations.
    NetworkX: A library for creating, manipulating, and analyzing graphs, potentially used for visualizing network structures within the cell images.

Getting Started:

    Install Python 3.6 or higher.
    Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
    Download the cell image dataset and ensure it's organized according to the project structure.
    Run the main script using python main.py.
